# 🧠 ITE351 – AI & Applications Group Project

Welcome to our project blog!  
This page is created for **assignment-group-1** of the ITE351 course, where we will document our upcoming AI project proposal, progress, and final results.

---

## 📌 Project Title  
**To Be Decided (TBD)**  

We are currently in the process of discussing possible topics for our final project.  
Our goal is to design an **AI-based application or prototype** that demonstrates the practical use of machine learning, data processing, or intelligent automation.

---

## 💡 Project Proposal (Draft)  

We plan to explore various directions such as:  
- Applying AI/ML techniques to solve a real-world problem  
- Analyzing datasets using machine learning algorithms (e.g., classification, regression, or clustering)  
- Building a small-scale prototype that integrates AI into an interactive system  

At this stage, we are reviewing potential datasets and brainstorming ideas that align with both **AI & Applications** and our team members’ interests.  
The final topic will be confirmed after team discussion and instructor feedback.
